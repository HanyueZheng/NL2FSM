Based on the values of the error counters, the CAN controller is set into the states: error-active, error-passive or bus-off.
The MCP2515 contains two error counters: the Receive Error Counter (REC) (see Register 6-2) and the Transmit Error Counter (TEC) (see Register 6-1). The values of both counters can be read by the MCU. These counters are incremented/decremented in accordance with the CAN bus specification. The MCP2515 is error-active if both error counters are below the error-passive limit of 128. It is error-passive if at least one of the error counters equals or exceeds 128.
It goes to bus-off if the TEC exceeds the bus-off limit of 255. The device remains in this state until the bus-off recovery sequence is received. The bus-off recovery sequence consists of 128 occurrences of 11 consecutive recessive bits (see Figure 6-1).
The MCP2515, after going bus-off, will recover back to error-active without any intervention by the MCU if the bus remains idle for 128 x 11 bit times. If this is not desired, the error Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) should address this.

If transmission is initiated via the SPI interface, the TXREQ bit can be set at the same time as the TXPx priority bits. When TXREQ is set, the ABTF, MLOA and TXERR bits (TXBnCTRL[5:4]) will be cleared automatically.Setting the TXREQ bit (TXBnCTRL[3]) does not initiate a message transmission. It merely flags a message buffer as being ready for transmission. Transmission will start when the device detects that the bus is available.
Once the transmission has completed successfully, the TXREQ bit will be cleared, the TXnIF bit (CANINTF) will be set and an interrupt will be generated if the TXnIE bit (CANINTE) is set. 
If the message transmission fails, the TXREQ bit will remain set. This indicates that the message is still pending for transmission and one of the following condition flags will be set:
• If the message started to transmit but encountered an error condition, the TXERR (TXBnCTRL[4]) and MERRF bits (CANINTF[7]) will be set, and an interrupt will be generated on the INT pin if the MERRE bit (CANINTE[7]) is set.
• If the message is lost, arbitration at the MLOA bit (TXBnCTRL[5]) will be set.
